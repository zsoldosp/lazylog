lazylog is logging facede written in Scala for existing JVM based logging
libraries to provide a cleaner API for clients to use.

	if(Logger.IsDebug)
	{
		Logger.Debug("Expensively constructed debug message");
	}
	
	
The purpose is to eliminate the above pattern while keeping the performance
benefits (avoiding the creation of unused string objects). This is achieved 
by using lazy evaluated parameters for the lazylog facede methods.

	Logger.Debug("Expensively constructed debug message");
